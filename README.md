# SSP2
The file must be installed directly in "C:\", so the Workspace will be named "C:\SSP2"
Libraries must be manually installed. For some reason the program would not run if the libraries came preinstalled in the workspace.
For some reason the program only works through the debugger. If the .EXE file is run, it will not work but will come up with a lot of errors stating the some library files could not be found.
Otherwise enjoy :)
